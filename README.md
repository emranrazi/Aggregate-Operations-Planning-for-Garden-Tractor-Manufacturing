# Aggregate Operations Planning for Garden Tractor Manufacturing

## Introduction
This document presents the aggregate production planning for a company manufacturing garden tractors over the next six months. The analysis considers various scenarios involving workforce, production, costs, inventory, and meeting forecasted demand.

## Scenario 1: Level Output/Workforce Plan
- Utilized Excel to evaluate a production plan with level output/workforce, maintaining a constant workforce level of 140.
- Allowed inventory to absorb uneven forecasted demand while permitting back orders.
- Analyzed the cost implications, including holding costs, back order costs, and workforce utilization.

## Scenario 2: Overtime Utilization Plan
- Developed an aggregate production plan incorporating the use of overtime to achieve an ending inventory of 1000 units at the sixth month, restricting maximum monthly overtime output to 400 units.
- Assessed the comparison between this plan and the level output/workforce plan in terms of costs and inventory management.

## Scenario 3: Temporary Workers Plan
- Explored the utilization of temporary workers during high-demand months, specifically during a second shift, ensuring an ending inventory of 1000 units by the sixth month.
- Evaluated the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of temporary workers in managing fluctuating demand.

## Conclusion
The analysis conducted using Excel for the three scenarios provided valuable insights into workforce planning, production levels, and cost implications associated with different strategies for meeting forecasted demand in the garden tractor manufacturing company.
